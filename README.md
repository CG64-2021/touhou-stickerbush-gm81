# touhou-stickerbush-gm81
A scrapped beta of a touhou fangame made using Game Maker 8.1

I used an extension called caster.gex so I can play .ogg files.<br>
You can get it here: https://moacube.com/resources/caster-multi-platform-ogg-extension-for-gamemaker/

- Reimu sprites were made by Harlttip0218 <br>
- Tilesets and sfx were taken from official games made by Nintendo and Sega <br>
- BGM music was made by Yaeru09: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilmb4s1I-ls <br>
